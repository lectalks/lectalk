      <article><h2>Good job! You're at Step 6. From this step all the way to Step 20, you will be doing exercises that involve being creative. Have Fun While Doing So. Here is your exercise for today: Create an animation about anything. It can possibly be a short story on any topic you want. Be creative. It can be a topic you are passionate about or even an awareness video. Perhaps you can make a story to show to your friends and family. You can use Moovly, a free platfrom to make animations. Do not do a cartoon video just yet - you will learn how to do that later. For now, try to create a short film with stock or personal images. Add narration, captions, and background music. That is what makes a good video. 
        </h2></article>
        <article><h2>Also, try creating your own artisitc portfolio with PowerPoint or Slides. Add a large space for your artwork, and a place for description and captions.This will come in handy if you are trying to apply for a job. </h2></article>
